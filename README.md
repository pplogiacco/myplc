# myplc

MyPlc project is part of Railways Modelling System ( https://www.rail2rail.eu ) 

The sketch implements a Very Simple Programmable Controller developed on Arduino Nano and some custom hardware modules.
The project also link external Loconet library (https://github.com/mrrwa/LocoNet).

Goal of the project is to standardize a methodology to wire the railway's models ensuring riability and compatibility with most commercial hardware based on Loconet protocol.
Cheap hardware and free software offers the opportunity to experiment innovative approch to railway's reproduction design and develop.
